        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My journey into coding began when I was around 10 years old, experimenting with math-based coding challenges on Khan Academy. This early exposure sparked my passion for programming, which led me to join a coding club class at Regis University when I was 13.

        While I hadn't created much at that time, the experience planted a seed that eventually grew during my senior year of high school when I took an AP Computer Science class. That class reignited my enthusiasm for coding and set me on a path to pursue it more seriously.
        
        After high school, I enrolled in Turing's Front-End Development program, where I learned technologies like React, JavaScript, and Cypress testing, among others. Completing the program expanded my horizons, and I ventured into full-stack development, creating passion projects to explore Python and its capabilities.
        
        What I love most about coding is solving puzzles. I don’t just seek answers—I strive to understand the why behind them. This curiosity fuels my growth as a software developer, giving me an edge when it comes to tackling challenges and building innovative solutions</p>
